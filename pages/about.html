                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    I am an undergraduate student pursuing a double major in Music and Computer Science, graduating in May 2026.
                    I have played the cello for 7 years and mostly play improvised music in contemporary and jazz contexts.
                    I am also interested in the development and use of technologies in musical contexts.

                <h3>Academic Interests</h3>
                <p>
                    My academic interests lie in the use of technology to create and support musical performance and I am particularly focused on the intersection between audio and visual media.
                    I'm interested in the ways that these intersections can be explored to produce new systems for creating music.
                    I am interested in data sonification, the use of audio effects to produce interesting visuals, and visual effects to produce interesting audio.
